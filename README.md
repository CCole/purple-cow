## Future Updates
- Figure out how to set up prettier configuration so that it does not conflict with vercel deployemnt
  - Prettier is important because it scans files for style issues and automatically reformats code for consistency. It's nice because it's a one time cost and an help catch errors.

- Add more informative error messages for improved user experience
- Implement a responsive design for a delightful experience across devices
